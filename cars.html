                There are a lot of cars in Dirt Rally. Here are some of my favourites. <a href="https://dirt.fandom.com/wiki/DiRT_Rally#Vehicles">Here</a> is a list of all of them.
            </p>

            <div>
                <img class="carImage" src="afbeeldingen/SubaruImpreza2001.webp">
                <p>In 2001, the Subaru Impreza S7 WRC rally car was built with the new four door body based on the GD Impreza chassis. 
                    It featured revised aerodynamics, improved weight distribution, and a lower centre of gravity. 
                    However, all the mechanical development from the previous year, including the engine, suspension, and drivetrain remained, with subtle refinements. 
                    In the same year, Richard Burns won his first and only World Driver's Championship with the Impreza.</p>

            <div>
                <img class="carImage" src="afbeeldingen/MitsubishiLancerEvoX.webp">
                <p>MML Sports was approached by Mitsubishi in 2010 to develop an upgrade kit for their customer Group N Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Xs. 
                    The kit converts it to R4 specification, and removes nearly 100 kilograms of weight, 
                    resulting in a second-per-kilometre advantage over the original Group N car on the stage. 
                    This draws it level with normally-aspirated Super 2000 rally cars. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img class="carImage" src="afbeeldingen/FordFiestaRSRally.webp">
                <p>Built for Ford World Rally Team by Ford Europe and M-Sport for use in the 2011 World Rally Championship, 
                    the Ford Fiesta RS WRC is a replacement to the Ford Focus RS WRC. 
                    It is powered by a turbocharged 1.6-litre inline-4 Ford EcoBoost engine. </p>
            </div>

            <!--<div>
                <img class="carImage" src="afbeeldingen/LanciaFulviaHF.webp">
                <p>After withdrawing from Formula 1 in 1955, Lancia returned to rally racing with the Lancia Fulvia Coup√© Rallye HF. 
                    It was only until 1967 an all-new 1.6-litre V4 engine was developed and installed on the 1967 Rallye 1.6 HF. 
                    From then, the Fulvia raced as a prototype until it received FIA's homologation in August 1969.
                    It has won the Italian Rally Championship every year from 1965 to 1973 and the International Championship for Manufacturers two rounds in advance in 1972. </p>
