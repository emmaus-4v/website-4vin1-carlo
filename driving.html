            <p>The game focuses more on the rallying, compared to previous entries in the DiRT series. 
                It uses a rebuilt physics engine compared to previous DiRT titles, which is more focused on simulation than arcade, 
                longer stages and more noticeable differences between FWD, RWD and AWD cars. The damage system are also tweaked to be more realistic. 
                It features six locations as rally stages: Greece, Monte Carlo, Wales, Germany, Finland and Sweden.
                The early access version contains cars from the 1960's, 70's, 80's, Group B, Group A, and 2010's Modern Rally. 
                Later, more classes such as F2 Kit Cars, R4, 2000's Rally and Hillclimb are added to the game.
                The Rallycross discipline was added to the game as a result of the partnership between the game and FIA World Rallycross Championship, 
                features three tracks: Lydden Hill, HÃ¶ljes and Hell, and introduces three classes of rallycross cars: Classic, S1600 and Supercars.
                The recurring rewind feature since DiRT 2, is not present in this game. 
                Players will also need to hire mechanic and engineers to repair their vehicles between the stages, 
                where their skills will determine the time taken and the amount of damage to be fixed.
